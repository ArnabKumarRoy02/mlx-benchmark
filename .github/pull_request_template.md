# Contributing to ⚡️ mlx-benchmark ⚡️

Thanks for opening this PR! A few checks before submission:

- [ ] I provide a description of the benchmark including by running `python mlx_benchmark/get_cpu_gpu_config.py` (e.g. **(Apple M1 Pro: 2E+8P+16GPU+16GB) - mlx: 0.2.0**)
- [ ] I verify that my benchmark was run on a newer version of MLX, or that my device is not yet integrated within the benchmark
